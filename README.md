# Hi, there ðŸ™Œ

**here is what I have done on the day-3 of A2SV, .NET Learning Path.**

### 1. Building a Shape Hierarchy : 
> In this programming task,I implemented a shape hierarchy using object-oriented programming concepts in C#. I created a base class for different shapes and derived specific shapes from it. The goal is to demonstrate my understanding of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and access modifiers.

### 2. Library Catalog : 
> In this programming task, I implemented a simple library catalog system using object-oriented programming concepts in C#. The system is a able to handle books and media items, such as DVDs and CDs. I designed and implemented classes to represent the library, books, and media items, and provided methods to perform various operations on them.
