**here is what I have done on the day-9 of A2SV, .NET Learning Path.**

### Title : Introduction To Clean Architecture: 
> This Task introduces Clean Architecture, a software design approach that divides applications into layers for improved development, testing, and maintenance. I was  provided with resources including videos and articles explaining Clean Architecture concepts in the context of .NET Core applications.

### Tasks:
1. **Blog API Task:**
   - Create a new project for the blog API following the Clean Architecture tutorial.
   - Establish a domain project.
   - Define domain types for blog and comments.
   - Set up an application project.
   - Create interfaces for blog and comment repositories.
2. **Create a Domain Project:**
   - Organize and structure the domain project correctly.
   - Design clear and well-organized domain concepts for blogs and comments.
4. **Create Domain Types for Blog and Comments:**
   - Define accurate and well-documented domain types for blogs and comments.
   - Ensure domain types effectively capture all required information for both entities.

5. **Create an Application Project:**
   - Set up the application project properly and ensure appropriate organization.
   - Create well-structured and accurate repository interfaces for blog and comment repositories.


Overall, part  helped me understand Clean Architecture concepts and guides  through practical tasks to apply these concepts by building a blog API using .NET Core. It emphasizes learning, understanding, and effective implementation of the Clean Architecture principles for creating better software applications.
