# Hi, there ðŸ™Œ

**here is what I have done on the day-6 of A2SV, .NET Learning Path.**

### PostgreSQL Practice on Leetcode : 
> I did a set of SQL practice problems on Leetcode. The problems range in difficulty from easy to medium, and I encouraged to attempt all of them. Solving these SQL practice problems have enhanced my PostgreSQL skills and boosted my confidence in handling various database challenges. The problem set includes tasks like combining tables, finding big countries, identifying duplicate emails, and more. By mastering these concepts, I became confident in PostgreSQL, a valuable skill for data management and analysis in modern applications.
