**here is what I have done on the day-2 of A2SV, .NET Learning Path.**

### 1. Student Grade Calculator : 
> It is a console application that allows students to calculate their average grade based on different subjects. The application prompts the student to enter their name and the number of subjects they have taken. For each subject, the student enters the subject name and the grade obtained (numeric value). After entering all subjects and grades, the application displays the student's name, individual subject grades, and the calculated average grade.
### 2. Word Frequency Count : 
>It is a C#  function that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each word in the string. Treating the words in a case-insensitive manner and ignoring the punctuation marks.
### 2. Palindrome Check
> It is a C# function that takes a string as input and checks whether it is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
