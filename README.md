# Hi, there ðŸ™Œ

**here is what I have done on the day-14 of A2SV, .NET Learning Path.**

### Title:  Blog APP with Clean Architecture
On this day14 , I completed the authentication and authorization of the BlogAPP. for this purpose I used Microsoft Identity with JWT. I found it much easier than another frameworks' authentication and authorization method. 
####  Authentication:
Authentication refers to the process of verifying the identity of users accessing the system. With the integration of Microsoft Identity, I established a secure mechanism to ensure that individuals are who they claim to be before granting them access. This involves validating user-provided credentials like usernames and passwords, offering a robust layer of protection against unauthorized access.
####  Authorization:
 Authorization, on the other hand, involves determining the level of access and actions users are permitted to perform within the application. Through the utilization of JWT, I've been able to assign specific permissions and roles to different users, regulating what parts of the application they can interact with. This careful control makes sure data stays safe and users can only do things that match their assigned roles.
