# Hi, there ðŸ™Œ

**here is what I have done on the day-4 of A2SV, .NET Learning Path.**

### 1. Simple Task Manager Project : 
> The project is a console-based application that allows users to manage their tasks by adding and viewing them. It will demonstrate the use of enums to categorize tasks, object initializers to create Task objects, lambda expressions for filtering tasks, and asynchronous programming to handle file operations. It provides a beginner-friendly application that uses various concepts in C#, enabling to practice enums, object initializers, lambda expressions, asynchronous programming, and exception handling in a manageable project.
