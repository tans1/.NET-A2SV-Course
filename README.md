# Hi, there ðŸ™Œ

**here is what I have done on the day-5 of A2SV, .NET Learning Path.**

### 1. Student Management System: 
> The projects is a console application for managing students' information. Implementing a generic class to store and manage student data. The program  allows the user to add new students, search for students by name or ID, display a list of all students, and serialize/deserialize the student data to/from a JSON file.
