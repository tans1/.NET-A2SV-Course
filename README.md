# Hi, there ðŸ™Œ

**here is what I have done on the day-10 of A2SV, .NET Learning Path.**

### Title: Clean Architecture - II: Building a Blog API with Clean Architecture

This task, Clean Architecture II, continues from the previous day's work. Today, I successfully implemented the Core, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers of the project in a more detailed and organized manner. Additionally, I established a connection with PostgreSQL and populated data in the database.

**PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system known for its robustness, extensibility, and adherence to SQL standards. With features like advanced indexing, full-text search, and support for various data types, PostgreSQL stands out for its reliability and scalability. It's a preferred choice due to its active community and ongoing support.

In summary, this phase of the project deepened my understanding of Clean Architecture concepts. The practical tasks led me through the process of building a blog API using .NET Core in a comprehensive and informative manner. The emphasis on learning, comprehension, and effective application of Clean Architecture principles underscores the creation of superior software applications.
